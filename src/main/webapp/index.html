        <h1>CSD322 Servlet Example</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>A servlet will mix client code (html/css/javascript) with server side code (java).  This is undesirable since it requires programmers to understand client side code and client side developers to understand service side code.  The code is hard to read, difficult to maintain and just plain messy.  JSF separates the view from the model and controller code which is usually on the server.</p>
